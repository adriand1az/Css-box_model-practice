# CSS Box Model Practice
website - 

The box model in css is the idea that everything in css is a box
## Goal
Get a better understanding of how the box model works. 
1. Border
    - The border around the element - think search bar.    
2. Padding
    - The space between the content in the content box and the border
    - The words or items compared to the total dimensions of that item.
    - Think of a learn more button
3. Margin
    - The space outside of the border
4. Width and Height
    - Set the width and height of an element.
5. Border Radius
    - Allows us to curve the border so its not always a rectangle or square
6. Display Property
    - Inline elements - fit alongside other elements on the same line
    - Blocke elements - take up an entire block of space pushes other elements to a seperate line
7. Units - Perentages, EM, & Rem
    - percentage - typically the percentage of the father element
    - Ems - usually the size compared to the font. 1 is the same size of the element itself. 2 em is 2 times the font size. Ems go based off of the parent element (It can continually get smaller or larger)
    - Rems - GO off of the root element (Will always use the root element as its baseline)
